            <p>Biography<br>
            Joubert was born on August 30, 1971, in San Francisco. He gained the nickname "Wood" as a kid while playing baseball. After high school he became a semi-pro arena football player. He worked as a football coach and as a deacon at the St. Paul Tabernacle Baptist Church in San Francisco.</p>
            <p>In 2010 he took part in having imagery taken of him as a side profession, ostensibly to make ends meet during tough financial times.</p>
            <p>Joubert died of a heart attack in 2016 at the age of 45.</p>
            <p>This page was created to return the man from the meme - a de-memeing. Restoring the humanity and remembering those lost in the memiverse. Partial proceeds will go to the family of Wardy Joubert III.</p>
